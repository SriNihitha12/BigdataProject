This table summarizes the performance of different machine learning models used for traffic volume prediction.  
Each model was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), where a lower value indicates better accuracy.


| **Model**           | **RMSE** | **Accurate or Not?**                                         |
|---------------------|---------:|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression   | 417.32   | Not the most accurate                                        |
| Decision Tree       | 363.70   | Accurate                                                     |
| Random Forest       | 363.70   | Accurate                                                     |
| XGBoost             | 363.70   | Accurate                                                     |
| CatBoost            | 363.47   | Most Accurate                                                |
| Prophet             | 80.58    | Highly Accurate (best for trend/seasonal time series)       |


## Recommendation

Based on the RMSE values:
- **Prophet** is the most accurate overall and is highly recommended for time-series data with seasonal patterns.
- Among traditional ML models, **CatBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** show similar performance and are good choices for real-time prediction.
- **Linear Regression** performs less accurately and may not capture complex traffic patterns well.

For best results, use Prophet for long-term trend analysis and CatBoost or Random Forest for real-time volume prediction.
