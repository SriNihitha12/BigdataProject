# üö¶ Real-Time Traffic Analysis and Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based solution for forecasting traffic volume using real-world transportation data from the Minnesota Department of Transportation. We applied a variety of regression models to predict hourly traffic flow based on historical data, time features, and sensor information.

## üìÅ Dataset

We used the `Minnesota_TrafficData_2020-24.csv` dataset containing 5 years of hourly traffic data collected from highway sensors across Minnesota.
This dataset was created by combining multiple annual traffic reports (from 2020 to 2024) into a single Excel file. Each year's data was merged, cleaned, and standardized to form a unified dataset for model training and analysis.
