# 🚦 Real-Time Traffic Analysis and Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based solution for forecasting traffic volume using real-world transportation data from the Minnesota Department of Transportation. We applied a variety of regression models to predict hourly traffic flow based on historical data, time features, and sensor information.
