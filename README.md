# üö¶ Real-Time Traffic Analysis and Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based solution for forecasting traffic volume using real-world transportation data from the Minnesota Department of Transportation. We applied a variety of regression models to predict hourly traffic flow based on historical data, time features, and sensor information.

## üìÅ Dataset

We used the `Minnesota_TrafficData_2020-24.csv` dataset containing 5 years of hourly traffic data collected from highway sensors across Minnesota.
This dataset was created by combining multiple annual traffic reports (from 2020 to 2024) into a single Excel file. Each year's data was merged, cleaned, and standardized to form a unified dataset for model training and analysis.

##  Key Features

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Removed null and empty rows
- Converted `date` and `hour` into proper datetime format
- Extracted features: `hour`, `weekday`, `month`
- Transformed wide format (24 hourly columns) into a long time-series structure

### 2. Analytical Components

**Traffic Trend Analysis**
- Average traffic volume by hour of day
- Volume trends across weekdays and months

**Model Training and Prediction**
- Regression models used:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Ridge & Lasso
  - SVR & KNN *(not optimal for large datasets)*
- Evaluated using RMSE to measure prediction accuracy

### 3. Visualization
- Traffic volume over time
- Heatmap of average volume by hour and weekday
- Actual vs Predicted plots for each model

### 4. Recommendations
-  Best Models: Extra Trees and Ridge Regression (fast + accurate)
-  Time features like `hour` and `weekday` significantly boost prediction
-  Avoid SVR and KNN for large-scale data due to performance issues
